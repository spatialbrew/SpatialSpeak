SpatialSpeak with Leaflet
============

Inspired by a prolonged (but great) ArcGIS.com student presentation, SpatialSpeak is an example boilerplate that students can use for timed spatial presentations using Leaflet.  

Purpose
---------
*GIS Analysts* Demonstrates how easy it is to create a web map using Leaflet.  Demos using setTimeOut for keeping a Geospatial presentation running within a time limit.  

*Would Be GIS Developers* Those interested in programming are expected to take the concept (timed spatial presentation) and create a reusable presentation tool with Leaflet using configurable data.  


Coming Soon
-----------
This could be a groovy little project.  Split out into a proper project structure and add examples of data for locations.  Let the end-user set the number of minutes at the beginning of the presentation.
